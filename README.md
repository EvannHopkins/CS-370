## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists design and build systems, create software, and solve complex problems using programming and algorithms. They work in many areas, from developing applications and managing data to ensuring cybersecurity and improving automation. Their work matters because it influences nearly every part of our lives, from the apps we use to how businesses operate and communicate. By finding solutions to real-world problems, computer scientists help improve productivity, make information accessible, and enable new technologies.

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
When approaching a problem, I break it down into smaller parts, focusing on understanding the core issue before looking for solutions. I would choose the best tools and methods to address the problem, considering efficiency and practicality. I also test and refine my solutions, working through different possibilities to ensure they’re effective and reliable. Problem-solving requires a mix of logical thinking, creativity, and a willingness to adapt to new information or challenges.

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As a computer scientist, my ethical responsibility is to ensure the technology I create is safe, transparent, and respects user privacy. I need to design systems that are secure, reliable, and easy to use, ensuring they don’t harm the end user or expose them to risks. For the organization, it’s important to consider how my work affects the broader community and ensure that decisions are made with honesty and accountability. Balancing the needs of users and organizations with ethical practices helps ensure that technology benefits everyone fairly.
